Last Session
------------
Collisions are sort of in place. I rewrote the collision detection to be lazier, eg. faster. Something weird, though, is that collisions only seem to happen on the top set of walls.

This Session
------------

+ Jittering Issue
    + Might be caused by running too slow and running out the buffer.
    + Reviewing a recording shows that it just stops, it doesn't go backwards. Might be a problem with double -> int rounding on display.
    + Only occurs when you outrun the camera. Must be something to do with the how that is handled.


+ Graphics

Next Session
------------
+ Fix side collisions which jump oddly.

+ Make better graphics, these current ones are depressingly bad. Low-fi, limited pallet is ideal.

+ Fix annoying jittering.

Future
------

+ Implement enemies, initially with temp sprites.

+ Fix that super annoying stuttering that the player does.

+ Camera management is weird, and the responsibilities of `TestState` are even weirder. Maybe split into `CameraController` or something?

+ Collisions are __DUMB__ right now, with _O(n<sup>2</sup>)_ checking


Ideas
-----

+ Change Player to a singleton class with a getInstance(). This will be better when I ultimately store player status in SQLLite or something.

+ Changing pallet for each level, monsters / tiles generated by abstract factory (fun!).
