Last Session
------------
Fixed jittering issue which turned out to be from the way I was handling camera movement. Now the camera is always centered on the player, which may not be ideal.

This Session
------------

+ Fix collisions.

Next Session
------------
+ Fix side collisions which jump oddly.

+ Make better graphics, these current ones are depressingly bad. Low-fi, limited pallet is ideal.

+ Fix annoying jittering.

Future
------

+ Implement enemies, initially with temp sprites.

+ Fix that super annoying stuttering that the player does.

+ Camera management is weird, and the responsibilities of `TestState` are even weirder. Maybe split into `CameraController` or something?

+ Collisions are __DUMB__ right now, with _O(n<sup>2</sup>)_ checking


Ideas
-----

+ Change Player to a singleton class with a getInstance(). This will be better when I ultimately store player status in SQLLite or something.

+ Changing pallet for each level, monsters / tiles generated by abstract factory (fun!).
